Flask Learning Journal

This is a basic app built with Python, Flask, and Peewee.

Once you run the app, you are provided with a blank "learning journal" with just one entry automatically entered.

The idea is to keep track of the things you learn on a daily basis in your life, keep up productivity.

You can add, edit, delete, and of course, view entries.
